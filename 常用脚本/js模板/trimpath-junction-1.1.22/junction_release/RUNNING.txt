Junction web-MVC framework and server, 1.1.22

Requirements:
 - Server software
   - Java 1.5+
 - Browser software
   - Firefox 2+
   - IE 6+, 7+
   - Safari (limited support: as Goggle Gears for Safari 
             is currently unsupported/unreleased)

Database:
 - For the server-side RDBMS, only Sqlite is currently 
   supported (2007/07/07).  Junction already includes 
   all necessary embedded Sqlite 3 drivers/libraries.

Running the Junction server:
 - Make sure you have Java installed already

 - For Windows, run...
   
   hop\start.bat

 - For Linux/Unix/OSX, run...

   hop/start.sh

 - Otherwise, try...

   cd hop
   java -jar launcher.jar -w 8080

Accessing the sample application:
 Open up a web browser, and...

 - First, run the application in the Junction web application server...

   http://localhost:8080/engines/100/apps/nextaction

   By accessing that URL, the server-side database will be
   automatically created for the nextaction sample application.

 - Next, to have the application executed within your 
   web browser, synchronized with the server-side database...

   http://localhost:8080/engines/100/apps/nextaction;start

Directory structure:
 - [junction_release]/        - Junction system code and files.
     docs/                    - Junction framework docs for developers.
     hop/                     - Helma Object Publisher (hop), 
                                with sqlite driver added.
     hop.apps/                - Junction server-side, coded as a hop app.
     public/                  - Static web directory.
     script/                  - Command-line scripts and tools.

 - [junction_release].spaces/ - User data and applications live here, where 
                                each subdirectory represents a team space.
     100/                     - A sample team space.
       __users__/             - Info about users who can use team space 100.
       nextaction/            - A sample application in team space 100.
         code/                - Next Action static code and resources.
           app/               - Next Action model-view-controller code.
           db/                - Next Action schema migration code.
           public/            - Next Action static web resources.
         db.sqlite3           - RDBMS for Next Action application in 
                                team space 100, created automatically 
                                at runtime.
       nextwiki/              - As an example, another app in team space 100.
         ...
     101/                     - As an example, another team space.
       ...

  The directory structure is designed to be able to upgrade
  the Junction system code and files easily in-place without 
  any accidental overwriting of user team space files.

  If you rename the [junction_release] directory, but be sure 
  to rename the sibling directory of [junction_release].spaces 
  to also have the same file root name.  For example, 
  'go_junction' and 'go_junction.spaces'.
